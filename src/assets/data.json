This page consists of a scoreboard which displays the time, goals, shots on goal, and powerplay/empty net status for each team. If it is a playoff game, the playoff round and series status is also displayed. Below the scoreboard is a list of goals scored in the game, each with detailed information about the goal. Whenever a team scores, the scoring team's goal horn is played, and a desktop notification with the details of the goal is displayed. The frontend of the application was built using JavaScript and React, and Electron was used to build the application itself.",
